# authenticity
Keys to prove the authenticity of my identity and posts later on

## What is this repository intended for?
Here I have a list of SHA-256 hashes, for which their original value remains unknown.  
If I ever need to prove the authenticity of a message in the future,  
I should attach a value and an index to the message,  
so that the hash of this value is identical to a hash in this list.

## Specifications
- Each hash can be used once
- Used hashes are checked
- Each hash is created using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm
- There isn't any rule about the length of original values
- Collisions are highly unlikely, but if such a case occurs, one should then prove one more hash value
